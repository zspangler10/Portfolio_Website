I wanted an easier way to navigate the job market, so I built a Python web scraper using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Pandas to grab job data from LinkedIn. 

After cleaning up the data in Excel and PowerBI, I got insights into top skills, seniority levels, and job market trends. The result? A streamlined job search with visual dashboards to guide my next career moves. 

Python did the heavy lifting, Excel cleaned up the details, and PowerBI made it all look sharp!
